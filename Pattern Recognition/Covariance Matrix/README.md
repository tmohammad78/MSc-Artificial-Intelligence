## Covariance Matrix 
### Introduction
The variance of a variable describes how much the values are spread. The covariance is a measure that tells the amount of dependency between two variables.<br />
The covariance matrix is a matrix that summarises the variances and covariances of a set of vectors and it can tell a lot of things about your variables<br />
For a matrix , we see an example in the code , but that formula comes from this:

The result of code :

We see at left chart , Parameters at main diagnol shows variance and others shows covariance and it means other variables are independent
